// The types.ts file is used to define reusable types and interfaces in a TypeScript project. It serves as a central place to store type definitions that can be imported and used throughout your project to enforce type safety and improve code organization. Here's what these types might be used for:
// disposable, filter, tree

export type DisposableOptions = {
    canSelectMany: boolean;
    openLabel: string;
    filters: FiltersObject;
};

export type FiltersObject = {
    [key: string]: string[]; // Allow any string keys with string[] values
};
  

export type TreeObject = {
    file: string;
    children: TreeObject;
};
